(Transcribed by TurboScribe.ai. Go Unlimited to remove this message.) What can I get you?

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.900
I'd like a large coffee.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.300
Okay, so hot coffee?

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:08.740
Hot coffee.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.900
Okay, room for cream?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.300
Totally leave room for cream.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.920
Why are you talking like that?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.320
Why are you talking like that?

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.820
Because this is my voice?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.040
This is my voice.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.800
No it's not, I heard you talking a

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.140
minute ago.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200
I know you don't talk like that.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.260
Neither do you, because nobody actually talks like

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.640
this.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.820
You choose to talk like this, and today

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.280
I chose to talk like this.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.920
That's pretty fucking annoying, isn't it?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.299
Why are you so rude, man?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.020
Just stop doing that.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.600
I can't help it, this is my voice.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.000
No, it's not.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.680
It's an affectation that annoying teenagers and rich

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.480
people use to sound like they don't give

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:41.920
a shit.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.060
Except you work in a coffee shop, so

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.820
I know you're not rich, and you don't

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.640
look like a teenager.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.140
Unless you're Eunice Kennedy Shriver, knock it off.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.320
So just because I talk like this means

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.100
I don't give a shit?

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.340
And what exactly am I supposed to not

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.900
give a shit about?

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.780
That's an excellent question to ask yourself in

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.980
your actual voice.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.980
Excuse me, some of us would like to

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.480
order.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.820
Fucking rude.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.800
You're a total dick, man.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.240
There, there you go.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.320
Good.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.760
You're talking.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.060
Wow.
